# Setup

To setup this app from scratch for first time with brand new aws account run:

```

2. Build app

# Clean up

To clean up you can run

```ts
cd infra
npx cdk destroy
```

# Hooks

Locally I use pre-push hook in .git/hooks/pre-push file

```bash
#!/bin/sh

if [ "$SKIP_SIMPLE_GIT_HOOKS" = "1" ]; then
    echo "[INFO] SKIP_SIMPLE_GIT_HOOKS is set to 1, skipping hook."
    exit 0
fi

if [ -f "$SIMPLE_GIT_HOOKS_RC" ]; then
    . "$SIMPLE_GIT_HOOKS_RC"
fi

cd frontend
npm run lint
```

I encourage to use and force lint for every run
